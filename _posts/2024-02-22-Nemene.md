This is probably not the correct date but it's the earliest changelog I could find.

### Introduction

Nemene is a Discord bot I was making for fun, the first thing I made on it was music playing stuff. I was experimenting with using APi and stuff basically, and I just kept doing that with other APIs and so this project became an experiment for working with APIs.

I'll add more details here when I have time.

This is unfortunately a closed-source project and a private Discord bot so no official publish...

### Mikoto Nikki

The bot's avatar on Discord is from [Mikoto Nikki by CHARON](https://enoshima210.work/2013/05/28/mn/){:target="_blank"}, and it is also this website's favicon as of the time I'm writing this.
