### Audr's Memo

This is my 4th ever released game project, my first ever 3D game, and my first ever collaboration with another developer! With the help of [NeonMocha](https://neonmocha.itch.io){:target="_blank"}, we made this game together in only 2 weeks! This is also the first time I've worked with another programmer so I have learned basic GitHub practices and workflow to develop smoothly, and we had basically no problems working together! ü§ù

By the way, the game is somewhat inspired by the meme style of üê± [SlappyHappy2000's Uncanny Cat Golf](slappyhappy2000.itch.io/uncanny-cat-golf){:target="_blank"}. I basically threw my brain away while deciding how the game should look and just used random meme models I found on [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/){:target="_blank"}. I think it's the easiest and most fun way to make the looks of a game lol. Also this time, I thought more about how to design the game to be fun, and I hope it did end up being fun for many people!

As this is my first 3D game üßä, I basically knew nothing about 3D before this, and I still don't lol but at least I learned a lot of new stuff about 3D! I've also definitely improved as a programmer with this project and I'll continue to add more to my experiences.

Overall, this project was so fun and I can't believe it only took 2 weeks, if I did it alone without Mocha, it would've probably taken me twice as much time so probably at least 1 month just to end up at the same result. However, school is starting again soon and I'm forced to work on another project which I have to do alone again. üòî

But I plan to join a game jam or make another random fun game after my next project. You know, thinking about it really makes me excited to finish that other project as soon as possible. It's pretty good motivation. ‚ö°

Thank you for reading this and I hope you enjoyed miku's shitpost course! I'm looking forward to working with Mocha again and possibly other people too to make more fun games in the future! üôÇ
